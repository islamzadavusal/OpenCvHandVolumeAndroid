# OpenCV Hand Gesture Volume Control

📱 **About the Project:**
This project was developed to control the volume with hand movements via the camera on Android devices. OpenCV is used to provide volume control based on hand detection and finger count.

---

## 🚀 Features:
- **Hand Detection:** Detects hand movements with the camera.
- **Volume Control Based on Finger Count:** The device's volume is adjusted based on the number of fingers detected.
- **OpenCV Usage:** External OpenCV library is integrated.

---

## 🌟 In Beta:
- This project is still under development. There may be bugs and performance issues.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used:
- **Kotlin:** Android application development language.
- **OpenCV:** Image processing library.
- **Android Camera API:** Camera integration.

---

## 🎯 Future Actions:
- Increase detection sensitivity.
- Design a more user-friendly interface.
- Develop a faster and more accurate finger recognition algorithm.
